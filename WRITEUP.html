						Spring
					</h3>
					<p>
						Spring is the Java backend used for this project. This is because it
						was highly recommended and easy to get started. While I have never
						used any Java frameworks for my projects, Spring has been fast
						enough to pick up and get running in less than a day.
					</p>

						NextJS
					</h3>
					<p>
						NextJS is the frontend used for this project. NextJS is a fullstack
						framework that utilizes React and serverless functions and heightens
						the power of React by providing serverless functions that can turn
						any web page into a server-sided, client-sided, or statically
						generated web page. This means that while in this project, NextJS is
						used primarily as a frontend to write React code, functions such as
						<code>getServerSideProps</code> can turn the webpage into a
						server-rendered page, allowing the developer to choose multiple
						rendering methods based on how secure the system needs to be.
					</p>
					<p>
						NextJS also has built in routing and API routes, which allows
						developers to hide their APIs from users to improve security, which
						is heavily utilized in this project.
					</p>
					<p>
						In any new project started, I would always recommend the use of
						NextJS (create-next-app rather than create-react-app), as it
						contains all the required functions of a React-app, but with
						elevated control for the developer with serverless functions.

						Tailwind CSS
					</h3>
					<p>
						Tailwind CSS is the utility-class focused CSS framework used in this
						project. It is a good combination with React due to its
						utility-class based design. Tailwind CSS is a great way to quickly
						create a consistent look and feel for your website.
					</p>
				</div>
				<div class="m-4">
					<h3 class="text-2xl font-medium">Yup</h3>
					<p>
						Yup is a Javascript Validation library that is frequently used in
						popular form libraries such as React Formik and Redux Form. It is a
						good way to validate forms in React due to its ability to write JSON
						schemas and easy and clean syntax.

					<h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-6">Code Quality</h2>
					<p>
						For the frontend, the pages were structured in a way that all page
						logics and states are handled within the page file. For example:
						<code class="bg-blue-900 rounded-md text-white p-1 px-3"
							>pages/index.js</code
						>
						contains all the logic for the home page and its states. However,
						large sections of the views are componentialized and are placed into
						the
						<code class="bg-blue-900 rounded-md text-white p-1 px-3"
							>components/*</code
						>
						folders. These component files do not have states in them. Any
						states and change that these components do do not come from the
						component itself, but rather the logics and functions are passed
						into them to be used. This makes the code more organized to read
						where the logics are.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						React as a framework also helps in making the code more readable.
						React, being a declarative framework, makes understanding the web
						page work begins by understanding React. For example, every page
						begins with useEffect. UseEffects run the moment the state hooks
						initialize or change. For example, in
						<code class="bg-blue-900 rounded-md text-white p-1 px-3"
							>pages/index.js</code
						>, you may begin reading the code by starting with the useEffect
						with no variable in the second argument. This means that this effect
						runs first in the page. Then, the page loading is done to retrieve
						data.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						As for Spring, due to my lack of knowledge in Spring and Java
						frameworks due to my inexperience with them, I am unable to
						factorize or arrange the code in any meaningful manner. The best I
						could do was semantically name my functions based on the functional
						requirements of the system. For example,
						<code class="bg-blue-900 rounded-md text-white p-1 px-3"
							>sendEmail</code
						>,
						<code class="bg-blue-900 rounded-md text-white p-1 px-3"
							>calculateSeatsPrice</code
						>, and
						<code class="bg-blue-900 rounded-md text-white p-1 px-3"
							>updateCinema</code
						>.
					</p>
				</div>
				<br />
				<br />
				<div class="m-2">
					<h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-6">Documentation</h2>
					<p>
						For the frontend, I have previously used JSDocs to document my
						functions and code. However, due to this project being a single
						page, I would prefer to comment on the codes and semantically name
						the functions to hint the purpose of the functions.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						The same goes for the backend, where commenting functions are done
						to indicate their purposes.
					</p>
					<br />
				</div>
				<br />
				<br />
				<div class="m-2">
					<h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-6">Security</h2>
					<p>
						All the important data checking in the front end such as seat
						availability and total price are performed server-sided. This means
						that API calls are done to the backend all the time to check if the
						seat is being occupied or has already been occupied by others, and
						the total shown in the payment is not handed in client side, but the
						total is still calculated once more on the server sided to ensure
						that the total price cannot be spoofed.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						However, due to this approach, you may notice some lag in using the
						system. For example, clicking on a seat would feel laggy. This is
						because clicking the seat would perform a check on server if the
						seat is available or not, decreasing performance. Another approach
						can be done, which is to allow these interactions be client sided,
						but it would affect the security and the integrity of said data.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Lastly, using Typescript was a thought for this project due to its
						strong typing and better syntax checking. However, Javascript is
						faster for prototyping and short development.
					</p>
				</div>
				<br />
				<br />
				<div class="m-2">
					<h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-6">Extensibility</h2>
					<p>
						Due to the frontend's structure, it is very possible to extend the
						system itself. However, the same cannot be said with the back end,
						due to my poor usage and understanding in organizing Spring Web
						systems. However, the flags and whistles required to extend the
						system in classes are there. This means that there are no absolutely
						fixed variables in the system. For example, the cinema can be
						dynamically changed, and other data such as bookingFee can be
						edited. It is also made with the idea that if the cinema system
						should be able to enable or disable certain seats, or make a cell in
						the seatGrid not a seat in the first place, it should be possible.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						Should there be a database to store the cinema data, it should also
						be allowed. In this prototype, a simple dictionary with Cinema
						generics is used, and the name of the cinema is cinema1. This may be
						changed according to GET requests of which cinema is to be obtained
						by a database, and return the cinema object. However, due to this
						being out of scope, it was planned to do so, but not implemented.
					</p>
					<br />
					<p>
						In summary, extensibility was a factor in deciding how to write the
						classes and how to organize the code.
					</p>
					<br />

				<div class="m-2">
					<h2 class="text-2xl font-medium mb-6">Test Coverage</h2>
					<p>
						As of this time, I have not yet implemented the test coverage.
						However, should I have implemented Tests, it would be done with Jest
						for the frontend.
